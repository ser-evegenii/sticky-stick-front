# react-cosmos-loader

Loader for rendering React components in isolation. This gets bundled with the user code and needs to be as low overhead and tech-agnostic as possible. In the future the React part of the Loader will be extracted as a plugin.

> **Warning: This is a strictly client-side module.** Do not depend on server packages (eg. `react-cosmos-config`) and do not utilize server modules (eg. `fs`)!
